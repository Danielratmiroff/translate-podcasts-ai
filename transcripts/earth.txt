We are all moving with the earth at 800 miles an hour. Do yeast. Because earth is rotate. If you stopped earth and you weren't seat belt buckled to the earth, you would fall over and roll 800 miles an hour, do yeast. It would kill everyone on earth. People be flying out of windows and that would be a bad day on earth.
